# React Wizard - Sample stepper's app with React and Material UI

This sample application illustrates a way to implement a stepper with React and Material UI.

It has been inspired from Brad Traversy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT62eVxShsY) and the sample provided in the official Material UI documentation (https://material-ui.com/components/steppers/).

The sample app is visible right here: (https://eloudsa.github.io/react-wizard/)

On the desktop, we use the Stepper component:
